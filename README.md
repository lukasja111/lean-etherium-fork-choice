# lean-etherium-fork-choice
Lean-Ethereum client-side fork-choice implimentation.


Basic fork-choice implementation rewritten from Lean-Ethereum python.

TO-DO:
-- Implement a function which would check whether the block is within Justifable window
-- Add more complex login in fn on_attestation currently function assumes that votes are always valid, need to implement a function which would check it.
-- Add testing
-- Merge with first teams code and try to integrate our fork-choice implementation with their modules.
