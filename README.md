# About

This repository contains our implementation of fork-choice based off the *Lean-Ethereum* outline for the client as found in their repository at [forkchoice.md](https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSpec/blob/main/docs/client/forkchoice.md) and follows the outline given by the project for fork-choice as seen in the [forkchoice](https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSpec/tree/main/src/lean_spec/subspecs/forkchoice) section of the repository.

# Testing

Tests will be performed based off the tests found in the leanEthereum repository [tests](https://github.com/leanEthereum/leanSpec/tree/main/tests/lean_spec/subspecs/forkchoice) section and also fork-choice tests outlined in [eth2.0](https://github.com/txrx-research/eth2.0-spec-tests/tree/fork_choice_integration_tests/tests/minimal/phase0/fork_choice/integration_tests).
